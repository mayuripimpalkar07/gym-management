## 📌 Project Overview

The Gym Management System is a full-stack web application developed to automate and digitalize the daily operations of a gym. It helps manage members, attendance, and administrative tasks efficiently.

Traditional gym systems rely on manual records or spreadsheets, which often lead to data duplication, data loss, and inefficiency. This project provides a **centralized and secure web-based solution** where all data is stored and managed efficiently.
